## [Unreleased]

### [Need to be] Added
- Newer trigger force feedback effects (check compatibility depending on the controller updates?)
- Search and implement Bluetooth version?
- Mics parameters implementation

### [Need to be] Fixed
- Internal speaker volume setter (need to find the right flags)

### [Need to be] Changed
- Use of UseLegacyRumble bool to a RumbleType enum {LegacyOnly (always sending legacy values even when 0), HDAndPause (discard any motor value but still automaticaly send 0 values whan HapticPaused is true), HDOnly (always discard motor values)}

### [Need to be reviewed for] Security
- Some values can be changed outside of the plugin as it is mainly using shallow copies


## [0.2.3] - 2022-01-10

### Added
- the possibility to set only one triggerState with the SetTriggerState() QuickSet (the other one can now be a null value)

### Fixed
- Corrected DualSenseGamepadHID.FindCurrent() description


## [0.2.2] - 2022-01-05

### Added
- "ResetResitance" option for triggerState (retract the actuator back instead of leaving it as with the NoResitance state)
- Inspector displaying rules for TriggerState struct

### Changed
- TriggerState struct is now Serializable and not Layout.explicit anymore to ensure unity inspector compatibilty


## [0.2.1] - 2021-12-01

### Added
- Possibility to change the volume of the controller (internal speaker or plugged in device) and access to these parameters in the sample scene. (internal speaker volume seems to be not fully working yet)

### Deprecated
- SetGamepadState method : use UpdateState() or directly set NewState property followed by UpdateGamepad instead.

### Fixed
- Restored the missing method SetGamepadState as deprecated for compatibility with 0.1.0 sample. This will surely be removed for the 1.0.0.
- Bug when setting legacy rumble to 0 while in haptic pause (they used to restart once the pause was over anyway);
- Side of rumble in the sample scene (the right and left used to be switched) 


## [0.2.0] - 2021-11-19

### Added
- Intelligent gamepad Update (limits the Updates to stricktly necessary ones). Still improvable (see "//TODO" comments...)
- Decoupling of gamepadState update (inner memory value) and gamepad update (physical update of the controller according to the gamepadStatestate)
- Possibility to deactivate legacy rumbles to use the HD one (with an external implementation).
- Events called for reset, pause and resume haptics to link a possible HD rumble implementation.
- New component in sample for regular auto updates
- New component in sample to pause and resume haptics (force feedbacks and rumbles)

### Changed
- Pause and resume haptics inner working
- Sample calls for gamepad updates (a lot less to avoid flooding the gamepad with outputReport)

### Fixed
- Bug which prevented legacy rumble or trigger force feedbacks wether the sample was executed in the Unity editor or a build.


## [0.1.0] - ????-??-??

### Added
- Main sample
- Reset functions
- CHANGELOG
- Gyro and Accelerometer
- DualSenseGamepadState struct
